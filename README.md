# Cinnamon 3D UI
Cinnamon is a 3D UI framework for more expansive and powerful UI code

This framework aims to give developers more options in how they use 3D user interfaces.
Implementing features that are completely missing from other 3D UI frameworks.

This is achieved with:
- Support for Animations (Tweens/Bezier Curves/Springs/Oscillators)
- Layouts
- Tree based hierarchy
- World anchored UI

This lets Cinnamon be more versatile for more games which might require different use cases

Cinnamon is good for:
- 3D menus systems
- level UIs
- 3d VFX
